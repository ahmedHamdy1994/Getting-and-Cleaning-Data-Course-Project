## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

### Modifications

#### the original data was modifies by


- Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Descriptions

### Identififiers

The first two columns - Subject and Activity - are Identifiers.

- Subject: the ID of the Subject
- Activity: the Name of the Activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken

#Measurements
As mentioned above,the variables remaining are just the calculatd means and standard deviations of these sets of data: (Even if I do not give a detailed description of what each data value means, you can see what it means by comparing it with the original data column.)
